This boutique collection of 34 designer residences is setting a new standard for architecture and design in Malvern, a suburb rich in history and heritage charm. 

Malvern’s proximity to the city and unparalleled connectivity will allow residents to live an inner city lifestyle and feel right at home in this highly desirable location. 

Boasting its status as the tallest building and first residential glass tower in Malvern, No.1 Como is an instant landmark overlooking the suburb. The combination and contrast of textures used in creating the striking curving glass façade and solid brick podium is testament to the thoughtful design by architects Tehla Clarke. 

The welcoming lobby foyer is the perfect first impression – with an open fireplace, marble finishes and feature lighting. This is just further reflected in the beautiful finishes and thoughtful floor plans throughout the building. 

With outstanding design and location as well as convenience and amenity right at your doorstep, No.1 Como is an opportunity like no other to live the ultimate Melbourne lifestyle.
